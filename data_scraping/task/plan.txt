i've scraped the plain html from web page.
found the div where all the products are listed

i was planning to divide them into individual divs and store in dataclasses.
each card would represend an individual product storing all the data about it
such as name, description, div class name, etc.

then i would use csv library 
to convert all the dataclasses into a single csv file
